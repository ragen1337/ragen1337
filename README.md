Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a seasoned Frontend Developer with over 6 years of commercial experience in JavaScript and React.js. For the past two years, I've had the privilege of leading teams, where I focused on bridging the gap between product vision and technical execution.

I am not just a task-completer; I am a dedicated problem-solver focused on delivering reliable and scalable solutions that truly impact end-users. My experience spans from agile startups to large-scale corporate projects, equipping me with the skills to tackle complex challenges and drive product success.

My Key Achievements
Team Leadership: Led a development team, managing requirements from product owners and overseeing the full product release lifecycle.

Performance Optimization: Significantly improved application performance by reducing page load times and enhancing user experience.

Efficient Migration: Spearheaded a major form builder migration from Angular to React, which condensed the development timeline from 6 months to just 1 month.

Innovation in AR: Developed several 3D editors for augmented reality (AR) technologies, resulting in a twofold increase in user-generated content.
